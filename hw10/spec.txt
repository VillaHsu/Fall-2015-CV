Implement zero-crossing on the following four types of images to get edge images (choose proper thresholds):
    - Laplacian
    - minimum-variance Laplacian
    - Laplacian of Gaussian
    - Difference of Gaussian (inhibitory sigma=1, excitatory sigma=3, kernel size 11x11)

You may generate the Difference of Gaussian kernel either by tk, matlab or in anyway you like.

Threshold Values listed below are for reference:
    - Laplace Mask Type1: 15
    - Laplace Mask Type2: 15
    - Minimum variance Laplacian: 20
    - Laplace of Gaussian: 3000
    - Difference of Gaussian: 1
