使用 lena.bmp 原圖寫程式做出下面幾種處理
1. upside-down 上下顛倒
2. right-side-left 左右顛倒
3. diagonally mirrored 對角線鏡射
4. rotate lena 45 degrees clockwise 順時針 45 度旋轉
5. shrink lena in half 長寬各縮小一半
6. binarize lena at 128 to get a binary image 二值化圖片，以亮度為 128 當作門檻值，大於 128 則變成 255, 否則變成 0
                                             
可以用 openCV or matlab 來寫作業。
基本概念就是把圖以 pixel 為單位讀進來，然後對 pixel 去處理來寫程式。

Homework 1: Basic Image Manipulation

• You may use any programming language of your choice to implement the functions required, provided that you do not use any library calls except for basic image IO.

• For part 2, you can use any image processing software. In your report, you must specify which software you used and the steps you took to obtain the required results.

• You must use the image 'lena' as your benchmark.

• Due date: 2015/09/29 2:20PM

• Grading policy

 – Failing to provide a report will reduce your grade by 1~2 levels.

 – Using restricted functions within your program (unless specified, as in part 2) will result in a failure of your work.

• Hint: for the hvision library, you may want to try around different linux machines. Since each linux has a different kernel, the precompiled library may not work on all machines.

• Hint: You can use any program language to implement homework. However don't just call libraries, if just call libraries you will get zero point.

1. Use B_PIX to write a program to generate
    (a) upside-down lena.im
    (b) right-side-left lena.im
    (c) diagonally mirrored lena.im
2. Use Photoshop to
    (a) rotate lena.im 45 degrees clockwise
    (b) shrink lena.im in half
    (c) binarize lena.im at 128 to get a binary image
